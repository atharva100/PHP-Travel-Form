This form asks users going on a college trip to fill details such as name,age,phone number etc and stores them in the database to maintain records.

Created using HTMl,CSS,PHP.
Uses MySQL database.

This was my first PHP project and helped me understand more of the server side functionalities and how connectivity with database works.
