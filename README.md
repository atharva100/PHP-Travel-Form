<b>PHP Travel Form</b>

<ul>
<li>This form asks users going on a college trip to fill details such as name,age,phone number etc and stores them in the database to maintain records.</li>

 <li>Created using HTMl,CSS,PHP.</li>
 
 <li>Uses MySQL database.</li>

 This was my first PHP project and helped me understand more of the server side functionalities and how connectivity with database works. 

</ul>
